## Intended Audience

Pathology residents, fellows, and faculty who have some experience with Microsoft Excel and are interested in performing clinical data analysis projects for research or quality improvement or both.

## Course Description

This course explores problems with "traditional" approaches to data analysis (i.e. using Microsoft Excel) and introduces an alternative that is reproducible, transparent, and suited for collaboration. We will take advantage of the R programming language and the RStudio integrated development environment, since these tools are free, wildly popular, and especially amenable to reproducible reporting.

In four 1.5 hour sessions, spread over the course of two weeks, we will cover how to import data from files and databases, how to explore the data and visualize it, and how to put together an attractively formatted report that summarizes the approach and findings, along with all the analytic programming code. Importantly, this report will be reproducible: anyone who has access to the raw data will be able to exactly reproduce all analyses and graphs in the report.

We will practice skills in class as well as outside. Each session’s lectures will be broken up by several interactive coding exercises to reinforce material just covered. After the four in-class sessions, participants will complete a course project: to generate a reproducible report that relates to a clinical quality or research problem. While this may seem daunting, technical help will be readily available. Finished course projects will be presented a few weeks after conclusion of the lecture part of the course. Note that "getting your hands dirty" is critical for cementing the mental models taught in the course. In addition, you may be able to submit the findings of your course project as a conference abstract for ASCP, USCAP, or similar.

This is **not** a programming course, and you will **not** be skilled at computer programming after completing it. But you will gain confidence in your ability to use R/RStudio to create a reproducible report in which you import, explore, and visualize clinical data.

## Goals

1. Gain an appreciation for the importance of reproducibility in data analysis
2. Learn a practical approach to reproducible analysis of clinical data


## Objectives

By the end of the course, participants will:

1. Define “reproducibility” and explain its importance as it relates to data analysis
2. Gain confidence in their ability to query databases, transform data, and create data visualizations
3. Generate and present, with the assistance of the instructor and peers, a reproducible report that 
	a. Poses a question broadly relating to an aspect of quality of care;
	b. Retrieves data from a data file or a clinical database;
	c. Visualizes the data graphically; and
	d. Presents relevant statistical summaries to address the question.
